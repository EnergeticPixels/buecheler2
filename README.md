=======================

http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/

What Is This?
-------------

This is a sample (quick, down and dirty) of a NodeJS, Express, Jade and MongoDB project.  This is a one up from previous tutorial in that we are using jquery for ajax transfer of data between front end and mongodb. Very
simple.  This application (tutorial) builds on what I learned in his first tutorial and brings in jQuery
framework and makes this a simple REST app.

This examples are meant to teach you about code-level development for NodeJS.


How To Use The Examples
-----------------------

There are three main ways to interact with the examples in this project:

1. NodeJS and MongoDB installed on the client computer.

2. This is the simple sequence:

* From the Node command line, issue the npm install command.

* After NodeJS, downloads and installs the node_modules, issue
npm start.  This will start the server.

* point your browser to localhost:3000/XXXXXXXX
